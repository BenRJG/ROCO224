Mars Rover
==========
**Background:** 
There are currently 4 rovers [3 Generations] on mars:
- Sojourner 1997 - 98 => Final contact attempt 9th March 1998, silent since 27th Sept 1997
- Spirit 2003/4 - 11  => Project concluded 25th May 2011, silent since 22nd March 2010
- Opportunity 2003/4 => Took first 'Selfie' 14th Feb 2018
- Curiosity 2011/12 => Drilling for "Lake Orcadie" target 20th Feb 2018

The mars rovers are generally equipped with a variety of equipment for manoeuvrability, sensing and analysing, and picture taking. In this task we will be primarily focusing on the arm and movent aspects specifically. The original Sojourner rover did not contain an arm however the remainder did therefore leaving 3 to use for research with our own design.

Typically the arms on three degree's of freedom, plus the "hand" or other tool.
 - One at the base, ["Shoulder"]
 - one half way, ["Elbow"]
 - and one at the head. ["Wrist"]
